# Games

At first, we thought about having one big game like space invaders, with mini games to follow. One of it is game1, which 2 players must use 'a', 'd', 'j' and 'l' letters to control 2 characters throwing knives at each other. Game2 is also fairly simple, in which a user tries to dodge a high speed bullet emmited from above. Our main game, space invaders, didn't finish on time, so we only have the 2 other sub game to submit

# How to open the game
